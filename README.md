### What is go?

Go is an old chineese game - it is thought to be the oldest board game continously played to present day. It has simple rules, but the possibilities and it's consequences are very complex. It is usually compared to chess. This game is a great way to spend some quality time with your peers or siblings. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>).

### Chineese rules

This project was created due to lack of proper GO online platform on chineese rules. I prefer chineese rules over japaneese/korean because I found its post-game dead groups removal rules a bit unclear. All the differences are explained [here](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/1841/what-are-the-difference-between-chinese-and-japanese-rules-in-go), but those do not influence the game flow - the changes are mostly visible in the methods of counting points. The results are very similar though.

## Development
